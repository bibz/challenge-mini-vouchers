note as disclaimer
    This overly simplistic data model assumes that
    all barcodes live in the system and are all siblings.
    That is, they are all issued under a common entity.
end note

System *- Barcode
System *- Customer
System *- Order

Order "*" -- "1" Customer : belongs to >
Order "1" o- "1..*" Barcode : assigns >

class Barcode {
    value: str
}
class Customer {
    id: int
    ...
}
class Order {
    id: int
}

note right of Customer: The identifier should be indexed.
